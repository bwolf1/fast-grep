# fast-grep

A faster grep tool!

[GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) is a command line tool for finding matching text patterns. GNU grep can operate on shell input or file input, and is particularly useful for highlighting matching test patterns within a large body of text.

fast-grep re-implements the GNU grep tool using Go's built in concurrency to make fast-grep faster than GNU grep.
