# fast-grep

## TODO


### Phase 1

- [ ] Write functionality to identify patterns in a line of text
- [ ] Implement a way to handle both input files and shell input
- [ ] Create a function to display matched lines
- [ ] Process command line flags and arguments ([go-arg](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alexflint/go-arg) should work well for this)
- [ ] Use Goroutines to concurrently process data

### Note

You can use the following package:


### Phase 2

- [ ] Add tree view
- [ ] Add flags to ignore files based on a glob pattern
- [ ] Add a flag to invert matching (show lines that do not match)
- [ ] Highlight the matched pattern with a different color
- [ ] Add a flag to search for matches using a regular expression
